            I created a shipping server at Phillips to automate internal paperwork and facilitate fine-art shipments. 
            <br><br>
            Before me, Phillips was using an old inventory server from the early 2000’s that was not integrated with any of the new processes in the Operations Department. The shipping department had to painstakingly write down inventory from the old-server, which was often-times inaccurate. And then plug the information into other paperwork like sales-tax invoices/shipping documents/condition reports/ etc.

              Phillips hired me to work on their new “Aged Property Project”; which I ultimately took charge of when my manager left the auction house. I worked closely with the regional COO on this project, which was a brain-child of the global COO.
              <br><br>
              Thousands of paintings, sculptures, watches, pieces of furniture, and other high-end items were collecting dust in Phillips’ network of warehouses; forgotten or left behind by their owners for a myriad of reasons. This “aged property” had taken over the warehouses and was costing the auction house hundreds of thousands of dollars annually in insurance costs and 3rd party storage fees. 
              <br><br>
              My task was to call/email/send letters to the estranged clients and coordinate shipments to clear the warehouses. 
              <br><br>
              This proved to be a very complex task that went far beyond shipping. The auction business is based on the sensitive relationship between the art specialist and the collector. I had to insert myself into each and every relationship and navigate legal issues; frozen assets; drama; etc. Sometimes I would speak with a collector and they would decide to resell their property; in which case I would need to find an auction or specialist who was interested in the work.
              <br><br>
              Once I spoke with the art specialist and then talked to the client; and it was agreed upon to ship the artwork somewhere – then I needed to worry about the logistics. 
              <br><br>
              One headache was calculating the sales tax which is triggered by the shipping destination (technically all the property in the warehouse was in-transit and had not been paid); so sales tax needed to be calculated and then <b>collected from the client</b> before the shipment could take place.

                I created a Django server to store the inventory. This integrated with the new workflows and allowed for automation; such as instantly calculating the sales tax for a shipment and creating the invoice.
