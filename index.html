<p>First, create an email and assign it to a campaign. Then assign each campaign a sender email <i>(you could send emails from 25 email accounts if you wanted)</i>. Campaigns can be turned on and off; and you can tinker with each message to send at custom intervals.</p><br>
<p><b>Use Case:</b> While working at Phillips Auctioneers one of my tasks was to manage hundreds of fine art shipments. Each shipment had three parties to coordinate: <i>1) the client 2) the warehouse 3) the shipper.</i></p><br>
<p>I used a variation of this program to update all relevant parties for each shipment. And also to continuously ping stalled shipments to keep them moving. <b>I used my application to ship thousands of works of art in hundreds of shipments.</b> By the way, in terms of "weight"; these artworks were by artists like Picasso, Monet, Georgia O'Keefe and more. During one of my shipments a Jeff Koons sculpture of a balloon dog fell and cracked, but my hands were clean and we had insurance and everyone was made whole!</p>

        <h2><b>Project 2:</b> Data Scraping</h2>
        
        <h3>Email/Phone Number Extractor</h3>

        <p>Get as many emails/phone numbers as you can think of queries.</p>
        <div id="terminal"></div>
        <br>
        <p>I built a script to collect emails and phone numbers from websites using Python's Selenium module. And with alot of tinkering, found the correct mixture of delays and timeouts per page to run the program continuously without stalling out or being stopped by bot-detectors.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The program queries DuckDuckGo and accepts as many inputs as you can think of; you can specify the specific website you are looking for (Linkedin.com for example) by writing site:linkedin.com at the end of the query.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Getting creative in order to feed the program with a list of queries; I wrote a script using Python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).</p>
        
        <h3>Dropbox Metadata Extractor</h3>
        <p>I was tasked with organizing an expansive Dropbox account with no discernible structure.</p>
        <br>
        <p>After some research; I found out that Dropbox has an API that allows you pull metadata on files, automate uploading/downloading of files to your account, and perform bulk actions on your files such as renaming and moving files between folders.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I used this API to organize the Dropbox account, I renamed the files in a useful fashion and created a hierarchy of information.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Furthermore, we were primarily working with large video files and there was an issue with the files taking hours to download. Using the API, I set up a processes to download the large video files; splice them into more manageable chunks, and then upload the chunks to the server so that the videos could be quickly downloaded and used. I explain how to use the API in the following videos:</p>

        <h2><b>Project 3:</b> Blur Detection</h2>
        <p>Worked on a data collection project. Used FFMPEG to pull frames from source video without any quality loss. Then used Python OpenCV the % blur of each frame to get an "average blur". Every frame that was below two standard deviations of the average blur was deleted. This standarized the data collection and massively sped the mundane process.</p>

        <p>"Meltdown" is a game color-matching game I created. The premise is that there is an impending meltdown on humanity's Venus colony, and the user, who works at the doomed power station must match the color of hostile gama-rays. You have 10 seconds to match each gamma-ray color by sliding the color bars, and you keep going until you fail to match the color. </p>
