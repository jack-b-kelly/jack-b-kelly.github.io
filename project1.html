            I managed a team of 6 data collectors. We coordinated with broadcasters at professional sports stadiums to access camera feeds and record 4K video of games.
            <br><br>
            We used this "source video" to pull still-frames using FFMPEG (video manipulation software). These frames were then <b>manually</b> sorted by the data collectors to delete blurry frames, isolate specific player actions, and gather different angles of the stadiums.
            <br><br>
            These collected frames were to be "training data" fed into an AI program the company invented to place virtual advertisements into live sports broadcasts.

            Sorting through the 1000's of frames pulled each source video was time-intensive, repetitive, and difficult to organize. And our objectives were constantly shifting
            <br><br>
            We would get feedback from our clients at the sports networks and needed to shift tasks at breakneck speed. We would be half-way through gathering data to train our baseball model at a specific stadium; and then need to crank out soccer data to send to the engineers in Israel. Data collectors were dynamically tasked to different sports and different stadiums.
            <br><br>
            We were under pressure from our clients and our engineers to deliver data quickly. 7 people including myself were working on gathering the data and there needed to be a way to speed up the task and organize what everyone was working on. As I said, each individual stadium in each respective sport needed updated training data to improve the models.

            I created a Python script that drastically cut the repetitive work of deleting blurry frames from the training data. After deleting the blurry frames; I organized the unsorted data by game_date;sport;stadium;sort_status in our internal server.
            <br><br>
            I used OpenCV (computer vision module in Python) to establish a baseline of "sharpness" in a sequence of images. I graphed the data on a bell curve and could dynamically delete frames above the mean. 
            <br><br>
            This split the data in half and I was able to delete, for example; 15% of the data comprised of the blurriest frames in one fell swoop; rather than having to sort through each frame manually.
            <br><br>
            This drastically cut down sorting time and allowed the data collectors to refine their sorting on less data that already had the blurry frames removed. Data collectors could then be easily deployed to different sports or stadiums in the server and tracked on a spreadsheet because of my folder/file structure on our server.
